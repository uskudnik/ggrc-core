,PCI Program,PCI-DSS 3.1 Security Program (Reference Program),"
The PCI Data Security Standard specifies 12 requirements for compliance, organized into six logically related groups called ""control objectives.""  Each version of PCI DSS has divided these 12 requirements into a number of sub-requirements differently, but the 12 high level requirements have not changed since the inception of the standard.

To comply with the PCI-DSS security standards the following high level tasks must be completed.  Sub-tasks and procedures will be documented within the tool.
Identify and Create company the PCI-DSS Policy and Procedures (PnP)
Identify and Create the necessary company system / security processes
Answer the Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)
Perform gap analysis of the SAQ and PCI-DSS Requirements
Design and Configure Systems to meet PnP requirements
Design or Re-mediate any discrepancies of the SAQ  and PnP 
Perform a Risk Assessment (Annually)
Perform Periodic Tasks as Required
Procure an ASV Vendor

3.6.8.b Observe documentation or other evidence showing that key custodians have acknowledged (in writing or electronically) that they understand and accept their key- custodian responsibilities.","3.6 The manner in which cryptographic keys are managed is a critical part of the continued security of the encryption solution. A good keymanagement process, whether it is manual or automated as part of the encryption product, is based on industry standards and addresses all key elements at 3.6.1 through 3.6.8.<br> Providing guidance to customers on how to securely transmit, store and update cryptographic keys can help prevent keys from being mismanaged or disclosed to unauthorized entities.<br> 
This requirement applies to keys used to encrypt stored cardholder data, and any respective keyencrypting keys.<br><br> 

Note: Testing Procedure 3.6.a is an additional procedure that only applies if the entity being assessed is a service provider.<br> <br> 

3.6.1 The encryption solution must generate strong keys, as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms under ""strong cryptography."" Use of strong cryptographic keys significantly increases the level of security of encrypted cardholder data.<br> <br> 

3.6.2 The encryption solution must distribute keys securely, meaning the keys are distributed only to custodians identified in 3.5.1, and are never distributed in the clear.<br> <br> 

3.6.3 The encryption solution must store keys securely, for example, by encrypting them with a keyencrypting key. Storing keys without proper protection could provide access to attackers, resulting in the decryption and exposure of cardholder data.
A cryptoperiod is the time span during which a particular cryptographic key can be used for its defined purpose. <br> <br> 

3.6.4 Considerations for defining the cryptoperiod include, but are not limited to, the strength of the underlying algorithm, size or length of the key, risk of key compromise, and the sensitivity of the data being encrypted.<br> 
Periodic changing of encryption keys when the keys have reached the end of their cryptoperiod is imperative to minimize the risk of someone’s obtaining the encryption keys, and using them to decrypt data.<br> <br> 

3.6.5 Keys that are no longer used or needed, or keys that are known or suspected to be compromised, should be revoked and/or destroyed to ensure that the keys can no longer be used. If such keys need to be kept (for example, to support archived, encrypted data) they should be strongly protected. The encryption solution should provide for and facilitate a process to replace keys that are due for replacement or that are known to be, or suspected of being, compromised.<br><br>

3.6.6 Split knowledge and dual control of keys are used to eliminate the possibility of one person having access to the whole key. This control is applicable for manual key-management operations, or where key management is not implemented by the encryption product.<br> 
Split knowledge is a method in which two or more people separately have key components, where each person knows only their own key component, and the individual key components convey no knowledge of the original cryptographic key).<br>
Dual control requires two or more people to perform a function, and no single person can access or use the authentication materials of another.<br><br>

3.6.7 The encryption solution should not allow for or accept substitution of keys coming from unauthorized sources or unexpected processes.<br><br>

3.6.8 This process will help ensure individuals that act as key custodians commit to the key-custodian role and understand and accept the responsibilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

• For acceptance of only trusted keys and/or certificates<br>
• For the protocol in use to only support secure versions and configurations (that insecure versions or configurations are not supported)<br>
• For implementation of proper encryption strength per the encryption methodology in use<br><br>

4.1.g For TLS implementations, examine system configurations to verify that TLS is enabled whenever cardholder data is transmitted or received. <br>
For example, for browser-based implementations:<br>
• “HTTPS” appears as the browser Universal Record Locator (URL) protocol, and<br>
• Cardholder data is only requested if “HTTPS” appears as part of the URL.<br><br>

• Overview of migration project plan including target migration completion date no later than June 30, 2016.<br>
• Cardholder data is only requested if “HTTPS” appears as part of the URL.","Sensitive information must be encrypted during transmission over public networks, because it is easy and common for a malicious individual to intercept and/or divert data while in transit.<br> Secure transmission of cardholder data requires using trusted keys/certificates, a secure protocol for transport, and proper encryption strength to encrypt cardholder data. Connection requests from systems that do not support the required encryption strength, and that would result in an insecure connection, should not be accepted.<br> Note that some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain control of the affected system. Whichever security protocol is used, ensure it is configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of an insecure connection—for example, by using only trusted certificates and supporting only strong encryption (not supporting weaker, insecure protocols or methods).<br> Verifying that certificates are trusted (for example, have not expired and are issued from a trusted source) helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. <br> Generally, the web page URL should begin with ""HTTPS"" and/or the web browser display a padlock icon somewhere in the window of the browser. Many TLS certificate vendors also provide a highly visible verification seal— sometimes referred to as a “security seal,” ""secure site seal,"" or “secure trust seal”)—which may provide the ability to click on the seal to reveal information about the website.<br> Refer to industry standards and best practices for information on strong cryptography and secure protocols (e.g. NIST SP 800-52 and SP 800-57, OWASP, etc.)<br><br> Regarding use of SSL/early TLS: Entities using SSL and early TLS must work towards upgrading to a strong cryptographic protocol as soon as possible. Additionally, SSL and/or early TLS must not be introduced into environments where they don’t already exist. At the time of publication, the known vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in POS POI payment environments. However, new vulnerabilities could emerge at any time, and it is up to the organization to remain up-to-date with vulnerability trends and determine whether or not they are susceptible to any known exploits.<br> Refer to the PCI SSC Information Supplement: Migrating from SSL and Early TLS for further guidance on the use of SSL/early TLS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Device vendors may also be able to provide security guidance and “how to” guides to help determine whether the device has been tampered with.<br> The frequency of inspections will depend on factors such as location of device and whether the device is attended or unattended.

This allows an entity to gain a better understanding of their potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks.<br> A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that may include exploiting identified vulnerabilities. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps a penetration tester will perform in order to plan the testing strategy, although it is not the only step. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.<br> Penetration testing is generally a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester uses their knowledge of systems to penetrate into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a means to gain access to an application server, they will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to. In this way, a tester is able to simulate the methods performed by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment.<br><br> Penetration testing techniques will be different for different organizations, and the type, depth, and complexity of the testing will depend on the specific environment and the organization’s risk assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,SYSTEM-6,Authorization Roles and Permissions,"<b>Authorization </b>(also spelt <b>Authorisation</b>) is the function of specifying access rights to resources, which is related to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security"" title=""Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security"">information security</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"" title=""Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"">computer security</a> in general and to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control"" title=""Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control"">access control</a> in particular. More formally, ""to authorize"" is to define access policy.
